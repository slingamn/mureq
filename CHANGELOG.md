### API breaks
* `json` kwarg now accepts an arbitrary object to be serialized as JSON (matching the Requests behavior), instead of already-serialized JSON

### Added
* Added `raise_for_status()` and `json()` methods to the `Response` type, increasing API compatibility with Requests (#2, #4, thanks [@mikeckennedy](https://github.com/mikeckennedy)!)
